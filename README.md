Thanks to [@eevee](https://github.com/eevee) at [http://veekun.com/](http://veekun.com/) for their SQLite Pokédex database, which powers this software. "veekun-pokedex.sqlite" was built from their database.

Thanks to the fine folks at [https://www.sqlite.org/](SQLite.org) for making it possible to use the Pokédex database... the source files "sqlite3.c" and "sqlite3.h" came from these people.

Thanks to those of Project Pokémon ([http://projectpokemon.org/](http://projectpokemon.org/)) who have helped research and document the underlying structure of Pokémon game save files.

Thanks to Nicholas Corgan ([@ncorgan](https://github.com/ncorgan)) for contributing directly to this project's code, making it more portable.
